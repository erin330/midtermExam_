I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night
Let's live like we're immortal
Maybe just for tonight
We'll think about tomorrow (yeah) when the sun comes up
'Cause by this time tomorrow
We'll be talking 'bout tonight
Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
No more wasted nights
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night
I don't wanna wait, no more wasted nights
